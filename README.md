## Creating color palettes using images Apollo Project images.

The code and tutorial (Jupyter Notebook) has been adopted from the Urban Goggles project, pitched at [AstroHackWeek 2016](http://astrohackweek.org/2016/). AstroHackWeek was a week-long summer schoole hoste by the Berkeley Institute for Data Science and GitHub HQ (San Francisco). Dates: 29th August – 2nd September<br>

The tutorial (a work in progress) is aimed at those who are relatively new to Python and would like to start using the matplotlib and scikit-learn packages. The images are from the [Apollo Project Archive](https://www.flickr.com/photos/projectapolloarchive/albums/)
