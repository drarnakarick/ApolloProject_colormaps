## Creating color palettes using numpy and matplotlib

These tutorials are based on the Urban Goggles project created at [AstroHackWeek 2016](http://astrohackweek.org/2016/).<br>
More information can be found ond on the AHW Wiki.<br>

The Jupyter notebooks take you through each step of the process, dissecting some of the functions along the way. The images were downloaded from the [Apollo Project Archive Flickr galleries](https://www.flickr.com/photos/projectapolloarchive/albums/) and the [Planet Labs Gallery](https://www.planet.com/gallery/)

#### Target audience:

Those who are new to Python and would like to start using the matplotlib and scikit-learn packages. Experience or familiarity with other programming languages (dare I say Fortran, IDL etc.) may be helpful. Comments and suggestions welcome.
